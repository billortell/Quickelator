This is just a quick-n-dirty calculator - er, umm, 'Quickelator'.

I'd personally use it in a helper class of sorts, and pull the variables out within a controller to define the restricted variables for use, but for now, because I'm unsure as to the 'reason' for choosing a framework for such a simple task - i'm open to committing this at least for now.
